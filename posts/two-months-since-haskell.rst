I will not promote Haskell.

Things to discuss:
- What are the key features in Haskell?
- What distinguish Haskell from other programming languages?
- What is "Purely functional programming"?
- Example program in Haskell.  

I'm going to begin with saying something controversial: I like Haskell, even
though I am fostered to write in sequential programming (or, informally,
"C-like" languages). And this article will be me about promoting the concept of
functional programming, especially Haskell.
