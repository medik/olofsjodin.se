.. topic:: A little story about keyboards today

	   One of the most overlooked computer peripherals must be the keyboard. Even if
	   computers today are faster and cheaper, keyboards has not. Most people has got
	   used to the fact that keyboards feels mushy and has no tactile feel.

	   `Rubber dome`_ is the most common used keyboard technology, it is cheap to make
	   and you can be sure that you use rubber dome switches if you are not sure what
	   you use. There are varieties, but the widely used one is called `rubber dome over membrane`_.

	   Cherry is a German computer peripheral-device maker, it is most known for its
	   mechanical key switches. It has been used in industrial electronics since 1980s,
	   but has not until recently gained popularity. The reason for this is not known,
	   it is common though that starcraft pro players used mechanical keyboards, and
	   because of the starcrafts popularity contributed to the increase of mechanical
	   keyboards. That is mine 5 cent on this subject, let me know if it is not the case.
	   
.. topic:: IBM Model M and MX Green

	   IBM Model M has regarded as a timeless and a durable keyboard. It is using a
	   buckling spring switch, which makes it stiff and got a tactile bump. What this
	   means is that you know when you have pressed a key. IBM does not make buckling
	   spring keyboards anymore. Today, Unicomp is the only company that manufacture
	   keyboards with buckling spring switches in the classic bulky grey style.

	   I would prefer smaller keyboards than thoes Unicomp makes, that is why I chose
	   to buy a keyboard with MX Green. Cherry tried to mimic the Model M buckling
	   spring switch with its MX Green line up. The actuation force for the MX Green
	   is 80 cN while the Model M is 90 cN, both got the tactile bump.
