I have recently checked in at `OpenWRTs old site`_ and saw that they
are now merging LEDE with OpenWRT. What this means for the OpenWRT
project is that the philosophy behind LEDE is included for future
OpenWRT releases and the latest official OpenWRT is now an LEDE.

People that runs older releases than OpenWRT 15.05 (Chaos Calmer) are
required to upgrade if they want security and bug fixes.
