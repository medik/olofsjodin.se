though I am fostered to write in sequential programming (or, informally,
"C-like" languages). And this article will be me about promoting the concept of
functional programming, especially Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;

on facebook, I spoke with my friends over XMPP i.e. jabber. This was possible
due to the fact that facebook ran on XMPP. Sadly, this is not true
today. Facebook decided to shut down their XMPP support. However, some people
decided that it was a good idea to reverse engineer the Facebook Messenger to
make their own implementation of the facebook messenger protocol. And now their
is a plugin to Bitlbee, which is an IRC server which its purpose is to bridge
the instant messenger world like jabber, ICQ, Yahoo and so on, so now it is
possible to speak with people over IRC. Pretty cool huh? I will guide you into
the big "how".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am doing this setup on an Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Server, but the way should be
similar in other Debian like operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin by adding this to your /etc/apt/sources.list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jgeboski/xUbuntu_16.04 ./
deb http://code.bitlbee.org/debian/master/xenial/amd64/ ./
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, run these commands to retrieve their keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
wget -O- https://jgeboski.github.io/obs.key | sudo apt-key add -
wget -O- https://code.bitlbee.org/debian/release.key | sudo apt-key add -
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install bitlbee and the facebook add-on with apt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
apt install bitlbee bitlbee-facebook
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the bitlbee service is on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sudo service bitlbee start
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it should be up and running. Start your irc client and connect to localhost.
Go to the &amp;amp;bitlbee channel, make sure that the facebook plugin is loaded by
writing "plugins".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add your account, make sure that you have generated an app password. You can
do that here:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security&amp;amp;section=per_app_passwords&amp;amp;view"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security&amp;amp;section=per_app_passwords&amp;amp;view&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the generated password by running the following command in the &lt;cite&gt;&amp;amp;bitlbee&lt;/cite&gt; channel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
account add facebook &amp;lt;username/email&amp;gt; &amp;lt;password&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, run "account on" to connect. Congratulations, you should be able to
talk to your facebook friends over IRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://olofsjodin.se/posts/facebook-over-irc/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2017 23:10:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>MX Green Keyboard</title><link>http://olofsjodin.se/posts/mx-green-keyboard/</link><dc:creator>Olof Sjödin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="topic"&gt;
&lt;p class="topic-title first"&gt;A brief history of Mechanical Keyboards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked computer peripherals must be the keyboard. Computers today
are evolved, CPUs are faster and a harddrive can contain gigabytes of data. Sadly,
this is not the case with keyboards. The price of cheaper keyboards and higher
profit margins leads to lower quality keyboards. A vast majority of all keyboards on the market
are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rubber_dome"&gt;Rubber dome&lt;/a&gt; keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are Rubber dome keyboards so bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are varieties of Rubber dome keyboards
like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rubber_dome_over_membrane"&gt;rubber dome over membrane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cherry is a German computer peripheral-device maker, it is most known for its
mechanical key switches. It has been used in industrial electronics since 1980s,
but has not until recently gained popularity. The reason for this is not known,
it is common though that starcraft pro players used mechanical keyboards, and
because of the starcrafts popularity contributed to the increase of mechanical
keyboards. That is mine 5 cent on this subject, let me know if it is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="topic"&gt;
&lt;p class="topic-title first"&gt;IBM Model M and MX Green&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Model M has regarded as a timeless and a durable keyboard. It is using a
buckling spring switch, which makes it stiff and got a tactile bump. What this
means is that you know when you have pressed a key. IBM does not make buckling
spring keyboards anymore. Today, Unicomp is the only company that manufacture
keyboards with buckling spring switches in the classic bulky grey style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would prefer smaller keyboards than thoes Unicomp makes, that is why I chose
to buy a keyboard with MX Green. Cherry tried to mimic the Model M buckling
spring switch with its MX Green line up. The actuation force for the MX Green
is 80 cN while the Model M is 90 cN, both got the tactile bump.&lt;/p&gt;
