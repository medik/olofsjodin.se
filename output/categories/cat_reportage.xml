&lt;p class="topic-title first"&gt;A brief history of Mechanical Keyboards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked computer peripherals must be the keyboard. Computers today
are evolved, CPUs are faster and a harddrive can contain gigabytes of data. Sadly,
this is not the case with keyboards. The price of cheaper keyboards and higher
profit margins leads to lower quality keyboards. A vast majority of all keyboards on the market
are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rubber_dome"&gt;Rubber dome&lt;/a&gt; keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are Rubber dome keyboards so bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are varieties of Rubber dome keyboards
like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rubber_dome_over_membrane"&gt;rubber dome over membrane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cherry is a German computer peripheral-device maker, it is most known for its
mechanical key switches. It has been used in industrial electronics since 1980s,
but has not until recently gained popularity. The reason for this is not known,
it is common though that starcraft pro players used mechanical keyboards, and
because of the starcrafts popularity contributed to the increase of mechanical
keyboards. That is mine 5 cent on this subject, let me know if it is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="topic"&gt;
&lt;p class="topic-title first"&gt;IBM Model M and MX Green&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Model M has regarded as a timeless and a durable keyboard. It is using a
buckling spring switch, which makes it stiff and got a tactile bump. What this
means is that you know when you have pressed a key. IBM does not make buckling
spring keyboards anymore. Today, Unicomp is the only company that manufacture
keyboards with buckling spring switches in the classic bulky grey style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would prefer smaller keyboards than thoes Unicomp makes, that is why I chose
to buy a keyboard with MX Green. Cherry tried to mimic the Model M buckling
spring switch with its MX Green line up. The actuation force for the MX Green
is 80 cN while the Model M is 90 cN, both got the tactile bump.&lt;/p&gt;
