About me
--------

I am a self-taught computer enthusiast, and is currenly pursuing a degree in
Master of Science in Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
   
I find the world facinating, that is why, as a kid, I try to find
information on how the world works. At the age of twelve I already
knew how to program in ASP, which is a programming language focussing
on websites. Today, I am a master in Linux and Python, and are
using my programming skills to create programs that makes everyone's
life easier. See my `github`_.

Also, I like to watch movies, listen to music, run, read magazines
and books. I like comics. I play Hearthstone and Terraria from time
to time, I am also a sucker for retro games like Super Mario and A
Link to the Past.
