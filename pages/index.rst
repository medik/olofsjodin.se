.. topic:: Introduction
	   
	   Welcome to my webpage! Here you will find stuff related to
	   programming, hardware and other things that are on my mind. You are
	   welcome to share the material on this website with others.

	   I am involved in several projects with KTH and friends from school.
	   Are you interested to having me work on your project? Then, please
	   send me an E-mail with a brief description of your project, and what
	   role you want me to fulfill.
	     

.. topic:: About me
	   
	   I am a self-taught computer enthusiast and are currenly pursuing a
	   Master of Science in Engineering degree at KTH Royal Institute of
	   Technology. My major is in physics.
	   
	   I find the world facinating, that is why, as a kid, I try to find
	   information on how the world works. At the age of twelve I already
	   knew how to program in ASP, which is a programming language focussing
	   on websites. Today, I am a master in Linux and Python, and are
	   using my programming skills to create programs that makes everyone's
	   life easier. See my `github`_.

	   Also, I like to watch movies, listen to music, run, read magazines
	   and books. I like comics. I play Hearthstone and Terraria from time
	   to time, I am also a sucker for retro games like Super Mario and A
	   Link to the Past.
