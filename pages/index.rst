.. topic:: Introduction
	   
	   Welcome to my webpage! Here you will find stuff related to programming, hardware and other things
	   that are on my mind. You are welcome to share the material on this website with others.

	   I am involved in several projects with KTH and friends from school. Are you interested to having
	   me work on your project? Then, please send me an E-mail with a brief description of your project,
	   and what role you want me to fulfil.
	     

.. topic:: About me
	   
	   I am a self taught programmer currently pursuing a degree in M.Sc in Engineering at KTH Royal Institute
	   of Technology. My major is in physics with a passion for programming and computers. Since I
	   was twelve I started to program in ASP, then I switched from ASP to PHP, from PHP to Java, and
	   finally I stopped at Python which is my main language today. Even if programming played an
	   important part of my childhood, it was only a tool to solve self-defined problems. It is a journey
	   that left me with a lot of experience in software development, talking to like minded people,
	   and helping others that aren't as fortunate as me.

	   Also, I like to watch movies, listen to music, run, read magazines and books. I like comics.
	   I play Hearthstone and Terraria from time to time, I am also a sucker for retro games like
	   Super Mario and A Link to the Past.
